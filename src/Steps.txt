Create a password-based account using Firebase
 - In firebase.js export const auth = getAuth(); as it will be common
 - createUserWithEmailAndPassword

Sign in a user with an email address and password
 - signInWithEmailAndPassword

To make the user id available throughout, setup redux store
 > npm i -D @reduxjs/toolkit
 > npm i react-redux
 - create store: appStore.js
 - create user slice: userSlice.js
 - provide appStore to app in App.js

Get the currently signed-in user (firebase)
 - The recommended way to get the current user is by setting an observer on the Auth object: onAuthStateChanged
 - this is to be done only once so set it using useEffect in Body.js
 - dispatch the addUser action using useDispatch

useNavigate to navigate to browse page when user is signed in -> Login.js

Add user icon and sign out button in header
 - use firebase signOut to handle sign out and navigate to login page
 - if user is logged in then only show sign out option, for this subscribe to store using useSelector hook in Header.js

Updating user profile using firebase updateProfile
 - Adding this in Login.js inside createUserWithEmailAndPassword when user is signed in
